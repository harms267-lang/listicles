# Three First Impressions of GenAI in Technical Writing

This week in my Writing with Digital Technologies class, we discussed how AI platforms like Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot can contribute to 
technical and professional writing. Prior to this week, the use of AI in my classes was strictly prohibited, and for good reason. Professors want students to avoid plagiarism 
and encourage students to produce their own work. The use of AI in assignments isn't always bad or disingenuous. In some cases, it can be used as a helping
tool for writers. In this listicle, I'm gonna discuss how AI can be used as a helping tool, my concerns with AI, and my first impressions of it.

## AI as a Helping Tool

AI can be used as a tool to help writers in the outlining and researching phase. In the beginning stages of the writing process, researching and note-taking on the topic at 
hand makes up the beginning phase. It's important to find the right articles and papers for research, and oftentimes it's desireable to have a good mix of popular and scholarly
articles. AI can help writers find sources that correlate with their topic by typing a prompt into it asking it to find sources for you. For example, typing "Find me X amount
of scholarly articles about X" will result in an output of sources that likely coincide with the given topic. In some cases, AI can even be used to draft a rough outline, but this
varies depending on an instructor's AI policy.

## Concerns with AI

Although AI can be used in a helpful and productive way for writers in the drafting process, writers must be wary of the output it produces. Oftentimes, AI might cite sources that
aren't accurate or peer-reviewed, making it easier to get false information. Sometimes, AI will even cite sources that don't even exist. This is why it's always important
to fact check everything the AI puts out. Another concern with AI that I have personally is the environmental impact. AI uses billions of gallons of water annually to keep
data centers from overheating. There's also concerns with AI replacing people's jobs, such as HR positions at companies. With the job market already in a tough spot, it's
hard to believe that AI isn't contributing to that. 

## First Impressions with AI

I have a very mixed first impression with AI in technical and professional writing. First off, I'm not used to using AI in my writing projects for two reasons:

* I usually am prohibited from using it in my writing classes
* I prefer to complete all steps of the writing process without the help of AI

For me, it's more rewarding and assuring to not use AI in the research and writing process because I feel like I have more control over the results I'm getting and 
the information I'm being shown. I'm very curious to learn more about AI in writing, as it might sway me to start using it to help with my projects.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm curious to learn more about how AI fits into technical and professional writing, and I'm certainly not opposed to integrating it into my writing process,
but I remain a bit wary because of the environmental impacts, as well as big tech companies like Google and Microsoft using people's inputs and data to train AI.
