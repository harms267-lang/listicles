# Key skills I've learned in Markdown

The first and second weeks of WRIT4662W: "Writing with Digital Technologies" have consisted of mostly learning about Markdown and how to use it in GitHub. 
I've learned so much about how markup languages work, and Markdown has been the perfect introduction to it. Because it is meant to be the simplest markup language, 
it uses plain text syntax and symbols that most people already know, such as asterisks and hashmarks, rather than using complex, inflexible code. 
The three main takeaways I've gathered from learning about and using Markdown is that you can use it to make lists, code, and quotes.

## You can use Markdown to make ordered and unordered lists

When it comes to making lists in Markdown, I've learned how to make both ordered and unordered lists. The main difference between them is that ordered lists are meant to be
read in a certain sequence (numbered lists) whereas unordered lists make sense in any sequence (bulleted or hyphenated list). Here's how to make numbered lists:

1. Start a new line
2. Press the `1` key
3. Press the `.` key
4. Add a space
5. Write your sentence

One convenient aspect about numbered lists is that once you start your `1.` sentence and start a new line, Markdown automatically adds the next number. Say I make my numbered list,
but forgot a step somewhere in the middle. After adding it, the numbers might not be in the right order anymore, or there may be duplicates when viewing it through "Edit",
but if you go to "Preview", you will find that the numbers are in the correct order. 

For unordered lists, you can use hyphens or bullets. It is mostly up to personal preference. For bulleted lists:

1. Start a new line
2. Press the `*` key
3. Add a space
4. Write your sentence

You can follow these same steps for hyphenated lists, just replace `*` with `-`. Similar to numbered lists, starting a new line will automatically generate another bullet or
hyphen.

## You can use Markdown to format inline and block code samples

Markdown can accomplish formatting both inline code and block code using "backticks"
Inline code is used to represent a single command. For example, to put inline code on the number six, type backticks on each side of the number with no spaces. This 
will give you `6`

```

To block an entire section of texts into code, start a new line, type three backticks,
add two new lines, write code, and when finished skip two lines and close code with
three backticks.

```

## You can use Markdown to make inline and block quotes

Making inline quotes in Markdown is incredibly simple and predictable. All you have to do is add "quote" marks (`"`) on both sides of the desired word or phrase.
One thing I never learned or used in my day-to-day life until today was block quotes. To make blocked quotes, just add a greater sign (`>`) to the beginning of each
desired line. The following is an example:

> This is a
> blocked quote.

Knowing how to properly make ordered and unordered lists, codes, and quotes in Markdown is incredibly helpful for the types of documents I'll
be writing later in the class, and most likely in my future career. Once I learn a few more skills in Markdown, I will be ready to write full essays and papers with it.
