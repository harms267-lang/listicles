<h1>
    First Impressions of HTML
</h1>
<p>


Today I learned about the basics of HTML in my Writing with Digital Technologies class. 
So far I've noticed that HTML is a bit more complicated than markdown, and there's a lot
of little coding things called elements to remember. My main three first impressions of 
HTML were that it differs from Markdown by using elements to edit the document, writers
have more creative freedom over their documents, and Visual Studio Code is a great platform
for writing in HTML.

When using HTML for the first time, I couldn't help but notice that it was vastly different
from Markdown in how the code works. In Markdown, edits are made by learning a small number
of codes, such as asterisks for bold or italic text, hashmarks for headings, and line spaces
to signal a new paragraph. It was incredibly simple to learn because it mirrored the way
we write naturally, making it the simplest markup language. HTML primarily differs by
offering only one way to edit documents, which is through elements. Elements are used to 
control all formatting, written as a tag between two brackets. Each tag performs
 a certain task, for example the "p" tag signals the start of a paragraph, and "/p" 
 signals the end of a paragraph. Using elements makes it easier to edit documents, but 
 because there are so many different elements, it takes a lot longer to learn than Markdown.

One positive to HTML offering so many different elements for formatting is that users can 
edit their documents in a more creative way. While Markdown is a wonderful markup language
for standard documents, its simple code doesn't have the facilities to edit documents beyond
just text. HTML elements can also include "attributes", which are extra features that can
be used to enhance text and allows for more specific editing. My favorite attribute I've 
learned so far is in the "div" and "span" element (depending on if I want inline or block)
where I can type "style", allowing me to highlight
the chosen text in any color. <span style="background-color: olivedrab;"> For example, I 
stylized this text in "olivedrab" color by using the "span" element, typing the "style" 
attribute, and then clicking "background-color" and scrolling through the options until
I found one I liked.
</span>
Stylizing text is a fun way to spruce up a document, and HTML is the perfect format to 
learn if you intend on using these features.

Visual Studio Code's simple layout makes it easy to navigate and learn HTML format. One feature
I like in particular is the toolbar that shows up while typing that helps me find shortcuts
for elements. For example, if I start typing "p", I get a dropdown bar with different elements
such as "p", "param", "pic", and more. This makes it especially easy to find what I'm looking
for, and is also good for learning how to use new elements.

</p>

    So far, I've enjoyed learning about HTML. In a way, I feel like I've "leveled up"
    from Markdown. Although it feels a little overwhelming to learn the new elements,
    I'm excited to get the hang of it until I can use it comfortably.
