# First Impressions of GitHub and Markdown

This week in my *Writing with Digital Technologies* class, I learned about what Markdown formatting was and how to use it in GitHub.
Previous to this class, I had never written assignments in any other way besides Microsoft Word and Google Docs. As someone who is not 
super "tech savvy", I was a bit nervous for this class, but also excited because I know it's exactly what I need. Below is a list of three
things I've learned this week about Docs as Code, GitHub, and Markdown.

## Docs as Code
Docs as Code refers to how writers use similar tools as software developers to create and edit documents. This is accomplished by using a source control system where files 
can be stored in a repository, which helps the creators or editors track changes that are made over time, making the editing process a lot smoother and more concise. 
I find that source control systems are also great for tracking collaborative projects with teams, because being able to see how each version is different and how 
teammates are making changes to the document is incredibly helpful for catching mistakes and tracking the writing process with each change committed.

## GitHub 
GitHub is one example of a source control system, and the only one I have used for this class so far. Groups and individuals can edit documents using plain text 
formats such as HTML (**H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) or Markdown. Existing documents can be uploaded or new documents can be created in GitHub, and descriptions 
are added to each new version to sum up the changes that were made, which allows for easier accessibility. When you go back to look from one version of your document to
another, you can see additions made to a document highlighted in green with a plus sign, and subtractions highlighted in red with a minus sign. So far, my first impression of GitHub
is very positive, and I think further use will help me become a more efficient editor. 

## Markdown

Markdown is a very simple plain text format to learn, as a lot of the standards match how we write naturally. For instance,
if you want to create a title in Markdown, you can type the title with equal signs on the line below it, which mirrors an underline commonly used when handwriting a document
to signal that it should stand out. Titles can also be written using hashmarks on either side of the line. One hashmark creates a title, two creates a heading 1, three 
creates a heading 2, so on and so forth. *Italics* can also be implemented by putting one asterisk or underline
on each side of the intended word or phrase, and **Bold** is implemented by putting two asterisks or underlines on each side of the intended word or phrase. I love this aspect of 
Markdown the most, because it provides users with an easier and faster way to emphasize a piece of text.

These three things I've learned in *Writing with Digital Technologies* are not only valuable to technical writers and editors, but they also all conveniently work together.
Docs as code, such as Github, are great soure control systems for editing that are compatible with Markdown and other plain text formats. They are also compatible with HTML and
other plain text formats, which is great for writers who need to use more than one.
